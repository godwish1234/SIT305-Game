# Henry comments 13/April
- Your JSON files are looking good, just maybe rename jsonFile to something more meaningful, like map.json
- Not enough commits from Nicholas to pass at this frequency.
- You're still missing a licenses.txt + changelog.md file.

# Henry comments 27/April
- Still not updated since last time.
